# <Coding 101: Learning the world of coding>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? Coding has always been incredibly interesting to me. For the longest time, I didn't believe that I was capable of learning something so foreign and complex. I woke up one day and thought to myself, "I'm smart and I am capable of anything I put my mind to." That was the day I decided to allow myself to try and enrolled in the Bootcamp.
- Why did you build this project? This project is proof that regarless of what your background is and where you are in life, anyone can learn how to code. This project allows me to admire my hardwork and being able to look over everything i've learned thus far.
- What problem does it solve? This project helps solve issues that I will have at some point when working with HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
- What did you learn? I learned how to create a study guide through coding. I learned the languages of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. I learned how to connect the languages and how they all work together in one project.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
